Key aspects of the DOM in JavaScript:
Tree Structure: The DOM organizes the document into a hierarchy of nodes, where each node represents a part of the document, such as an element, attribute, or text content. The document node is the root, and all other elements are its descendants.
Object Representation: Each part of the document (elements, attributes, text) is represented as a JavaScript object, allowing for programmatic access and modification.
Manipulation: JavaScript can use the DOM API to:
Select elements: Using methods like getElementById(), querySelector(), querySelectorAll(), getElementsByClassName(), getElementsByTagName().
Modify content: Changing textContent, innerHTML, or attribute values (src, href, class, id).
Change styles: Directly manipulating the style property of an element or adding/removing CSS classes.
Create and remove elements: Using document.createElement() and parentNode.removeChild().
Handle events: Attaching event listeners (e.g., addEventListener()) to elements to respond to user interactions like clicks, key presses, or form submissions.
Example of DOM manipulation:
JavaScript

// Select an element by its ID
const myHeading = document.getElementById('myHeading');

// Change its text content
myHeading.textContent = 'New Heading Text';

// Change its style
myHeading.style.color = 'blue';

// Create a new paragraph element
const newParagraph = document.createElement('p');
newParagraph.textContent = 'This is a new paragraph.';

// Append the new paragraph to the body
document.body.appendChild(newParagraph);
The DOM is fundamental for creating interactive and dynamic web experiences, enabling JavaScript to respond to user actions and update the web page in real-time.
